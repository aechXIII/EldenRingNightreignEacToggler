## Elden Ring EAC Toggler
Simple tool which lets you easily enable and disable EasyAntiCheat for Elden Ring.

Using this tool should be the preferred method as the old method where you replace "start_protected_game.exe" with a copy of eldenring.exe **will** cause issues after a game update, because when the game is launched through Steam, it will launch the game using the old copy of the executable, effectively making you play an older game version.
